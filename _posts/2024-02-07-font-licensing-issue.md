I am using some fonts in this project. I can not find the licensing information nor the source for these fonts anymore. I know that I downloaded them from some free fonts sites, but I really do not know where... :(

If you are the owner of one of these fonts, please [contact](/contact/) me! I will immediately link to your site!
