I created a small C program to authenticate against a [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix){:class="ext" target="_blank"}/[Pluggable authentication module (PAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module){:class="ext" target="_blank"} called [checkpw](https://git.xw3.org/xw3/checkpw){:class="git" target="_blank"}. This program is only for verifiying a user's password, that is registered in /etc/passwd using /etc/shadow, or whatever PAM is configured to use.

The program returns 0 on success, 1 otherwise.

With this program, it will be possible to authenticate an xw3 application user against the system's user database.

Currently only tested on [Linux](https://kernel.org/){:class="ext" target="_blank"}, but it should work on [AIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_AIX){:class="ext" target="_blank"}, [DragonFly BSD](https://www.dragonflybsd.org/){:class="ext" target="_blank"}, [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/){:class="ext" target="_blank"}, [HP-UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX){:class="ext" target="_blank"}, [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS){:class="ext" target="_blank"}, [NetBSD](https://netbsd.org/){:class="ext" target="_blank"} and [Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Solaris){:class="ext" target="_blank"} operating systems too. I will test API compatibility for all OS's listed soon... ;)

<span style="color:red;">HELP NEEDED!</span> I need some people porting or helping me porting this to other OS's than Linux. AFAIK it should compile on listed OS's above and should then work, but I don't know how... :(

Group permissions will be handled using /etc/group in a seperate program - Maybe just with a small wrapper around the "id" command (not available yet, but it should be easy to implement).
