I created a small C program to authenticate against a UNIX/[PAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module){:class="ext" target="_blank"} called [checkpw](https://git.xw3.org/xw3/checkpw). This program is only for verifiying a user's password, that is registered in /etc/passwd using /etc/shadow, or whatever PAM is configured to use.

The program returns 0 on success, 1 otherwise.

With this program, it will be possible to authenticate an xw3 application user against the system's user database.

Currently only tested on Linux, but it should work on the [AIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_AIX){:class="ext" target="_blank"}, [DragonFly BSD](https://www.dragonflybsd.org/){:class="ext" target="_blank"}, [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/){:class="ext" target="_blank"}, [HP-UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX){:class="ext" target="_blank"}, [Linux](https://kernel.org/){:class="ext" target="_blank"}, [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS){:class="ext" target="_blank"}, [NetBSD](https://netbsd.org/){:class="ext" target="_blank"} and [Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Solaris){:class="ext" target="_blank"} operating system too. I will test API compatibility for all OS's listed soon... ;)

Groups will be handled using /etc/group (not available yet, but it should be easy to implement).
