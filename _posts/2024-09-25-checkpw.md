I created a small C program to authenticate against PAM called [checkpw](https://git.xw3.org/xw3/checkpw). This program is only for verifiying a user's password that is registered in /etc/passwd using /etc/shadow, or whatever PAM is configured to use.

The program returns 0 on success, 1 otherwise.

With this program it will be possible to authenticate an xw3 application user against the system's user database.

Groups will be handled using /etc/group (not available yet, but it should be easy to implement).
