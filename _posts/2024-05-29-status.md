Development looks very slow here, but it isn't!

I am playing around a lot to define a more detailed concept. I have good ideas every day to make this software a helpful framework for low-level web application development.

I have this running on some customer devices, but I can't publish the code. I try to make all of the code open-source, but I better reimplement things to make it open and free...

Actually, I am planning an authentication layer and session management. The challenge to me is, to make authentication and session information available to all languages \(Bash, C, Lua, PHP and Python basicly\). I have tons of ideas, but am not able to decide for a solution... :\(

To make it clear, I am writing this project's code, because it is fun to me... It is an experiment! I want to learn more about CGI/FastCGI and primary the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/){:class="ext" target="_blank"} programming language.
